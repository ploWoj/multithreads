# Threads in collections

___

## Task: threads in collections

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Write a short program in which 20 threads are held in a vector
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Each thread has to wait 1 second, then display its number (taken as a parameter) and a space character
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Run the program several times and observe the results

## Task 5 - solution

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void do_work(int id) {
    this_thread::sleep_for(1s);
    cout << id << ' ';
}

int main() {
    vector<thread> threads;
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        threads.emplace_back(do_work, i);
    }
    for (auto && t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Why is this happening?

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> The output stream <code>cout</code> is only one. It is a shared resource that is shared between threads
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> There may be interlaces when accessing the stream (one thread will start typing something and will not finish, and the second one will interrupt it and enter its number)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> Sharing resources is a common threading problem
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> How to deal with this? This is a topic for the next lesson ðŸ™‚
